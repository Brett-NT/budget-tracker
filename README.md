# Budget Tracker Starter Code

## Description
This is an app designed to keep logs of an individuals transactions, keeping a chart of incoming and outgoing funds, as well as displaying a chart of income and spendature over time. Should you lose internet connection while inputting data, your transactions will be stored in cache data until a connection has been reestablished, in which case your recent transaction records will be stored in the server database with the rest of your transaction history.

## Installation/Deployment
This app has dependencies "compression", "express", "mongoose", and "morgan." Run "npm i" to install package.json. Deployment of this app is also available through Heroku via the link at the bottom of this page.

## Usage
Once the application is open, simply name a transaction (i.e. "payday", "morning coffee", "utilities bill", etc.) and enter the amount of the transaction. Then select if the transaction is adding to or subtracting from your balance, and the graph and chart will then reflect your new transaction. As stated above, should you lose connectivity while inputting new transactions, they will be saved in your cache data until internet connection has been reestablished.
